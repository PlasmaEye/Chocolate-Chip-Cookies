## Ingredients
- 226g (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 110g granulated sugar
- 324g light-brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla (preferably Mexican)
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 476g Flour
- 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips (half-bag)

## Mixing Instructions

### Cream Together
- 226g (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 110g granulated sugar
- 324g light-brown sugar

After mixing, let sit for at least 5 minutes to let the sugars dissolve in the butter.

### Mix In
- 2 teaspoons vanilla (preferably Mexican)
- 2 eggs

Mix until slightly fluffy.

### Combine
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 150g Flour

Stir together then add to existing mixture.

### Mix In
- 326g Flour
- 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips

Add the flour a little bit at a time. When about half of the flour is left add the chocolate chips to the flour and mix a little bit before adding the flour/chips mixture to the dough. This keeps the chocolate chips from clumping at the bottom of the bowl.

## Baking Instructions
- Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
- Roll the dough into balls a little smaller than a golf ball and place on a cookie sheet. Space the balls about 2 inches apart.
- Bake until the tops of the cookies start to crack and the sides start to brown, usually around 12 minutes.
- Take the cookies out of the oven and leave on the cookie sheet until the sheet is cool enough to hold. This lets the cookies bake a little bit more.
- Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.
- Ensure that the sheet is cooled before placing the next set of cookies on it. 

## Storage Directions
- Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week, if they last that long.
